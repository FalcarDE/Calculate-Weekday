# Calculate-Weekday
In this Project I tried to make a GUI, which allowed you to find out a certain Weekday from Day, Month and Year.


The GUI is very simple (maybe poorly) design, but in it works fine. I used Java Swing Libary and the AWT toolkit. 

This is how the GUI look likes:

If you give a Day, Month and Year in the Textfield and press the button. The programm will give you a correct weekday.
